# Summary: Search and replace across files using Ack and sed.
# Help: Find files using Ack matching a pattern, and then
# search and replace that pattern in those files.

# The pattern is a regular expression replacement pattern
# recognized by sed. Any other options are passed along to
# ack.
#
# The search query for Ack is the first part of PATTERN.
#
# EXAMPLES

#     aj acksed 's/foo/bar/g' --ruby app/helpers
#
